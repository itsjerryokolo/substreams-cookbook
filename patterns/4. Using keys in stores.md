## Keys in stores

We use store modules to aggregate the data in the underlying key-value storage. It is important to have a system for organizing your keys to be able to efficiently retrieve, filter and free them when needed.

Think of keys as a keyspace. You can build them in segments according to your subgraph logic. Segments are conventionally separated by `:`.

Here are some examples,
- `Pool:{pool_address}:volumeUSD` - pool total traded USD volume
- `Token:{token_addr}:volume` - total token volume traded
- `UniswapDayData:{day_id}:volumeUSD` - daily USD volume
- `PoolDayData:{day_id}:{pool_address}:{token_addr}:volumeToken1` - total daily volume of token that went through a pool in token1 equivalent

In the example of a counter store below, we increment transaction counters for different metrics that we could use in the downstream modules:
```rust
#[substreams::handlers::store]
pub fn store_total_tx_counts(clock: Clock, events: Events, output: StoreAddBigInt) {
    let timestamp_seconds = clock.timestamp.unwrap().seconds;
    let day_id = timestamp_seconds / 86400;
    let hour_id = timestamp_seconds / 3600;
    let prev_day_id = day_id - 1;
    let prev_hour_id = hour_id - 1;

    for event in events.pool_events {
        let pool_address = &event.pool_address;
        let token0_addr = &event.token0;
        let token1_addr = &event.token1;

        output.add_many(
            event.log_ordinal,
            &vec![
                format!("pool:{pool_address}"),
                format!("token:{token0_addr}"),
                format!("token:{token1_addr}"),
                format!("UniswapDayData:{day_id}"),
                format!("PoolDayData:{day_id}:{pool_address}"),
                format!("PoolHourData:{hour_id}:{pool_address}"),
                format!("TokenDayData:{day_id}:{token0_addr}"),
                format!("TokenDayData:{day_id}:{token1_addr}"),
                format!("TokenHourData:{hour_id}:{token0_addr}"),
                format!("TokenHourData:{hour_id}:{token1_addr}"),
            ],
            &BigInt::from(1 as i32),
        );
    }
}
```

In the downstream modules consuming this store, you can use these keys to work with the deltas based on your substreams logic. `substreams::key` module offers useful helper functions for that.

```rust
for delta in store_tx_counts.deltas.iter().filter(key::key_first_segment_in("token")) {
    let token_address = key::segment(&delta.key, 1);
    log::info!("Token {} trx count: {}", token_address, delta.new_value);
}
```

In the example above, we used `key_first_segment_in()` function to filter only token-related counters and then used `segment()` helper to extract the pool address.
